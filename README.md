Decision Trees: Titanic Dataset Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores decision trees in machine learning, applying them to predict survival in the Titanic dataset. The decision tree model is explained, and its advantages and limitations are highlighted. Key metrics like Gini Impurity and Information Gain are used to build a tree that predicts passenger survival based on features like sex, class, and fare.

Key Features:
Theory: Explains decision tree structure (nodes, branches, leaves).
Application: Predicts Titanic survival using features like age, sex, class.
Metrics: Uses Gini Impurity, Information Gain, and Mean Squared Error.
Model: Decision tree classifier with 82.38% accuracy.
Conclusion:
Decision trees are effective in predicting outcomes based on structured data and help identify important features like gender and class in survival prediction.
